## Installation
1. clone the repository
2. run ```python setup.py develop --user```
3. Download the [latest soplex release](https://github.com/SBRG/soplex_cython/releases)
4. Run ```pip install <PATH_TO_SOPLEX_WHL> --user```

Linux is recommended, with a relatively recent glibc. Ubuntu 14.04 or later
should work. Mac OS X probably works too. Windows has worked in the past, but
is not explicitly supported at this time.
